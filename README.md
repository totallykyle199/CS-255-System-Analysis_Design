# CS-255-System-Analysis-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

- Driver Pass wants a software to be designed that allows their customers help to pass their DMV tests

What did you do particularly well?

- I believe I was able to capture the needs and requirments Driver Pass was looking for. I also did well in creating the different diagrams needed to help visualize the software's design

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

- I would revise my UML class diagram, I believe I could have done a better job with the objects and classes, also improve the overall look of the design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

- I interpret the user's needs as reqwuirments that are needed to complete the software. It is important to also look at the needs from the user's perspective, how would the user want to use the system as well as a design you would be want to work with.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

- I approach designing software by taking notes of the clients requirments as well as looking at the software from a user's perspective. One technique that works well are user stories, feedback from actual potential users and new insights that could have been overlooked.
